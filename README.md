### Immutable Primative Types for Javascript (and TypeScript)

### NOTE: This is in early stages. Don't use this yet unless you'd really like to help testing it.

### Premise

Allows you to create a monad from any of the primatives (and Array) in Javascript. Also can create monads of other types. This allows you to build truly immutable values, with strict type enforcement without a TypeScript or Flow.

Very experimental! When this has proven usable it will be promoted version 1.x.

### Documentation

Coming soon! See unit test for examples for now.

## Development

Source is written in TypeScript. Run tests via `npm run test`.
